To capture data from a Keysight DCA-X Wideband Oscilloscope using Python, you can use PyVISA, which interfaces with Keysight instruments over GPIB, USB, LAN or Serial.

This is a basic script using pyvisa to:

Connect to the DCA-X

Set up the channel and acquisition parameters

Trigger a waveform acquisition

Fetch waveform data

Save it to CSV

Generate a screen shot of the waveform
